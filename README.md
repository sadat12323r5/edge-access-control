# edge-access-control
A secure, edge-based biometric access control system combining computer vision, embedded real-time control, hardware security, and multi-modal authentication.  The system separates high-level perception and networking from safety-critical actuation and control (MCU), enabling reliable, tamper-resistant operation suitable for real-world deployment.
